== YubiKey NEO App: OpenPGP


This project implement the OpenPGP card functionality used on the
YubiKey NEO device that is sold by Yubico.

This project is based on the 
http://sourceforge.net/p/javacardopenpgp/[Java Card OpenPGP Card]
project made by Joeri de Ruiter. 
The initial modifications we have made compared to
the upstream project are minor, but we reserve the right to make other
changes and improvements that are specific to the YubiKey NEO
hardware.

=== License

The upstream project was released under the GPLv2+ and our fork uses
the same license.  All of our changes are released under the same
license.  See the file LICENSE for more information.


=== Building

See doc/Building.txt for information on how to build the source code
and doc/InstallCAPFile.txt on how to install it.


=== Usage

The OpenPGP Card applet is typically used through http://www.gnupg.org[GnuPG]
so we refer to its documentation for the full reference.

We have tutorials on specific topics in at
https://developers.yubico.com/PGP[developers.yubico.com/PGP], for example card
editing and key import.
